## E2 Termination Service: Go Bindings

This package provides Go bindings for the gRPC services implemented by the ÂµONOS E2 Termination service.

It also includes some shared definitions of some E2SM related info, so that these can be shared
across different E2 Service Models and the E2T without introducing inter-dependencies.
